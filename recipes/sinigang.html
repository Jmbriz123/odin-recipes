        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pork Sinigang is a classic Filipino sour soup made with tender pork (usually belly or ribs) simmered in a tangy broth flavored with tamarind. It’s often cooked with vegetables like kangkong (water spinach), sitaw (long beans), labanos (radish), and eggplant. Known for its comforting, appetizing sourness, sinigang is a beloved Filipino dish often enjoyed with steamed rice.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the pork</strong></li>
            <p>In a large pot, place the pork and add water just enough to cover.

            <li><strong>Add aromatics</strong></li>
            <p>Add the sliced onions and tomatoes.
Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 45–60 minutes, or until the pork is tender.</p>
            <li><strong>Add the vegetables</strong></li>
            <p>Add the labanos (radish) and cook for about 5 minutes.

            <li><strong>Add the souring agent</strong></li>
            <p>Pour in the sinigang mix (or fresh tamarind extract if using).
Stir and adjust the sourness to your taste.</p>
            <li><strong>Season</strong></li>
            <p>Add fish sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.
