            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns (or cracked pepper)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, for a slightly sweet touch)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced (optional, regional variations)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking oil (optional, for sautéing)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the chicken</strong></li>
            <p>In a bowl, combine chicken pieces with soy sauce, vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns.
Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for better flavor).</p>
            <li><strong>Sear the chicken (optional but recommended)</strong></li>
            <p>Heat oil in a pan and brown the chicken pieces on both sides.
This adds extra flavor and texture to the meat.</p>
            <li><strong>Simmer the chicken</strong></li>
            <p>Pour in the marinade, then add water to help cook the chicken through.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for 30–40 minutes until the chicken is tender.</p>
            <li><strong>Adjust the flavor</strong></li>
            <p>Taste the sauce. If needed, adjust by adding more vinegar for extra tang, or a bit of sugar to balance the flavors.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Reduce the sauce</strong></li>
            <p>Let it simmer uncovered to reduce the sauce to your desired thickness.
Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</p>
            <li><strong>Serve hot</strong></li>
            <p>Serve with steamed rice, and optionally top with boiled eggs or a few chili slices for a spicy kick.</p>
