        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Filipino Beef Steak, or Bistek Tagalog, is a savory and tangy dish made with thin slices of beef marinated in soy sauce, calamansi (or lemon) juice, and garlic, then pan-fried and simmered with caramelized onions. It's known for its bold flavor and tender meat, often served with steamed rice. Bistek is a comforting and popular Filipino home-cooked meal.

            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1–2 tbsp cooking oil</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the beef</strong></li>
            <p>In a bowl, combine the beef slices with soy sauce, calamansi (or lemon) juice, minced garlic, and black pepper.
Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
            <li><strong>Sauté the onions</strong></li>
            <p>In a pan over medium heat, add a bit of oil and sauté the onion rings until they’re soft and slightly caramelized.
Remove and set aside for topping later.</p>
            <li><strong>Sear the beef</strong></li>
            <p>In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Pan-fry the marinated beef slices (in batches if necessary) until browned on both sides.
Do not overcrowd the pan</p>
            <li><strong>Simmer with marinade</strong></li>
            <p>Pour the remaining marinade into the pan with the beef.
Add a bit of water if needed to adjust the sauce.
Simmer over low heat for 15–20 minutes or until the beef is tender.</p>
            <li><strong>Add back the onions</strong></li>
            <p>Once the beef is tender and the sauce is slightly reduced, add the cooked onions on top.
Let them warm through for about 1–2 minutes</p>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
            <p>Serve hot with steamed rice.</p>
        </ol>
